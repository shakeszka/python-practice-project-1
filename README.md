# Python Practice Project 1

**Project Stage: In Process**

There will be more than five practice projects like this because I'm only starting with Python and need to learn basics.

The main goal of this project is to practice Python basics(especially, Classes and functions).

The main goal of the program is to let the user write their list of friends(along with their name, age, height, GPA), 
store the data in the file, and get any friend from this file. It also has a funny function that allows the user to know if the friend is stupid according
to their GPA.

### What did I learn during while working on this project?
1. Learnt how to use Pickle module(even though later I realized I don't really need it)
2. Got acquainted with the basics principles of Python PEP(the length of the line, naming conventions, the space betweent the lines)
3. Useful PyCharm shortcuts(e.g. "Ctrl" + "/")
4. Practiced using Classes and functions(class inheritance, multilevel inhertitance, variable overwriting, super function etc.)
